# Fake-web-store

This is a project i will be working on during my summer break from my studies. My goal is to build a mock web store using data from Dummy json API.

## Built as a Vite + React.ts web app

## If you try this app on its deployed version no money will be drawn, there is no bank service connected. This is just a MOCK store i made for myself to learn!

## Dependencies

1. **Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap**: For ui components
2. **Axios**: For making request to the api
3. **Tanstack Query**: For handling data fetching and state management
4. **React-router-dom**: For routing between pages
5. **Sass**: For CSS
6. **Zod**: For validating schema for forms
