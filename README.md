3. **Tanstack Query**: For handling data fetching and state management
4. **React-router-dom**: For routing between pages
5. **Sass**: For CSS

## Goals

1. List of all products with pagination
2. Filter products by category
3. Sort products by price, alphabetically, rating
4. Search for a specific product
5. View detailed information about a selected product
6. Add and remove products from cart
7. View cart summary and move on to checkout
