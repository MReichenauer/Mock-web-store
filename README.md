# Mock Store

## Project Overview
E-commerce store built in React 18, integrated with the Dummy JSON API.
Users can browse, sort, and filter between products, manage their shopping cart (add, remove, and adjust quantity), and place their order. 
I developed this project during my summer break (2024) as a fun way to grasp the fundamentals of React.

**NOTE:** If you try this app on its deployed version no money will be drawn from your account! There is no billing service connected.
